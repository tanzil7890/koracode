- To regenerate the legacy JavaScript SDK, run `./packages/sdk/js/script/build.ts`.
- After changing the public Protocol or Server `HttpApi`, run `bun run generate` from `packages/client`. Do not edit `src/generated` or `src/generated-effect` directly.
- Keep runtime dependencies directed from Schema to Core and Protocol, then from Core and Protocol to Server. Client runtime code may depend on Schema and Protocol but never Core or Server; `sdk-next` composes Client, Core, and Server.
- ALWAYS USE PARALLEL TOOLS WHEN APPLICABLE.
- Prefer automation: execute requested actions without confirmation unless blocked by missing info or safety/irreversibility.
- The default branch in this fork is `main`; upstream's default branch is `dev`.

## Branch Names

Use a short branch name of at most three words, separated by hyphens. Do not use slashes or type prefixes such as `feat/` or `fix/`.

Examples: `session-recovery`, `fix-scroll-state`, `regenerate-sdk`.

## Commits and PR Titles

Use conventional commit-style messages and PR titles: `type(scope): summary`.

Valid types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, and `test`. Scopes are optional; use the affected package or area when helpful, e.g. `core`, `opencode`, `tui`, `app`, `desktop`, `sdk`, or `plugin`.

Examples: `fix(tui): simplify thinking toggle styling`, `docs: update contributing guide`, `chore(sdk): regenerate types`.

## Style Guide

### General Principles

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Do not extract single-use helpers preemptively. Inline the logic at the call site unless the helper is reused, hides a genuinely complex boundary, or has a clear independent name that improves the caller.
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity
- Prefer functional array methods (flatMap, filter, map) over for loops; use type guards on filter to maintain type inference downstream
- In `src/config`, follow the existing self-export pattern at the top of the file (for example `export * as ConfigAgent from "./agent"`) when adding a new config module.
- In Effect generators, bind services to named variables before calling methods. Do not use nested service yields such as `yield* (yield* Foo.Service).bar()`.

Reduce total variable count by inlining when a value is only used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json()

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json")
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json()
```

### Destructuring

Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Use dot notation to preserve context.

```ts
// Good
obj.a
obj.b

// Bad
const { a, b } = obj
```

### Imports

- Never alias imports. Do not use `import { foo as bar } from "..."` or renamed imports like `resolve as pathResolve`.
- Never use star imports. Do not use `import * as Foo from "..."` or `import type * as Foo from "..."`.
- If a namespace-style value is needed, import the module's own exported namespace by name, for example `import { Project } from "@opencode-ai/core/project"`, then reference `Project.ID`.
- Prefer dynamic imports for heavy modules that are only needed in selected code paths, especially in startup-sensitive entrypoints. Destructure dynamic import bindings near the top of the narrowest scope that needs them so they read like normal imports. Avoid inline chains such as `await import("./module").then((mod) => mod.value())` or `(await import("./module")).value()`. Keep branch-specific imports inside the branch that needs them to preserve lazy loading.

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2

// Bad
let foo
if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### Complex Logic

When a function has several validation branches or supporting details, make the main function read as the happy path and move supporting details into small helpers below it.

```ts
// Good
export function loadThing(input: unknown) {
  const config = requireConfig(input)
  const metadata = readMetadata(input)
  return createThing({ config, metadata })
}

function requireConfig(input: unknown) {
  ...
}
```

- Keep helpers close to the code they support, below the main export when that improves readability.
- Do not over-abstract simple expressions into many single-use helpers; extract only when it names a real concept like `requireConfig` or `readMetadata`.
- Do not return `Effect` from helpers unless they actually perform effectful work. Synchronous parsing, validation, and option building should stay synchronous.
- Prefer Effect schema helpers such as `Schema.UnknownFromJsonString` and `Schema.decodeUnknownOption` over manual `JSON.parse` wrapped in `Effect.try` when parsing untrusted JSON strings.
- Add comments for non-obvious constraints and surprising behavior, not for obvious assignments or control flow.

### Schema Definitions (Drizzle)

Use snake_case for field names so column names don't need to be redefined as strings.

```ts
// Good
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text().primaryKey(),
  project_id: text().notNull(),
  created_at: integer().notNull(),
})

// Bad
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  projectID: text("project_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
})
```

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible, you shouldn't be using globalThis.\* at all unless it's the only option.
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package dirs like `packages/opencode`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (e.g., `packages/opencode`), never `tsc` directly.

## BrowserCode-specific notes

This repo is a fork of `anomalyco/opencode` that adds browser-use integration.
The opencode style above still applies to all TS code. A few extras:

### Modification zones

See `UPSTREAM.md` for the canonical version. Short form:

- **Green (add freely):** new files, new packages. `packages/bcode-browser/`
  is the home for BrowserCode-specific code (decisions §1d).
- **Yellow (touch + document):** edits to `packages/opencode/` source go in
  the maintainer-side `memory/browsercode/EXCEPTIONS.md` (kept outside
  this repo with the agent's roadmap/decisions docs) with justification.
  Every Yellow edit is a future merge-conflict candidate, so keep them
  surgical.
- **Red (never touch):** `@opencode-ai/*` package names, `@opencode/...`
  Effect service IDs, `x-opencode-*` wire headers, `OPENCODE_*` env vars,
  third-party provider User-Agents.

### Three-level architecture (decisions §1c)

- **Level 1** — pure additions in `packages/bcode-browser/`. No upstream
  diff. Always preferred.
- **Level 2** — thin adapters in `packages/opencode/src/tool/` that wrap
  Level-1 implementations. Small, mostly schema/context translation.
- **Level 3** — modifications to upstream source. Last resort. Document in
  the maintainer-side `memory/browsercode/EXCEPTIONS.md`. Always evaluate
  whether the change could be upstreamed as an extension point first.

### Vendored harness

`packages/bcode-browser/harness/` is vendored from
`browser-use/browser-harness`. Path-allowlist policy (post upstream PR #229
src-layout reorg):

- `agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py` — editable. Primary BrowserCode
  extension surface.
- `src/browser_harness/*.py` (`daemon.py`, `admin.py`, `helpers.py`,
  `run.py`, `_ipc.py`) — protected. Pull verbatim. If behavior change is
  needed, upstream a PR to `browser-use/browser-harness`.
- `interaction-skills/` — verbatim. Never edit.
- `(agent-workspace/)?domain-skills/` — **excluded** from vendored tree.
  Sync agents skip these paths; see UPSTREAM.md §3 "Excluded paths".

Sync workflow lives in `harness-sync.md`.

### Upstream sync workflow

Pull from `anomalyco/opencode`: see `opencode-sync.md`. Pull from
`browser-use/browser-harness`: see `harness-sync.md`. Both append a row
to `UPSTREAM.md`'s sync log.

When a sync PR is open, **do not land feature work on `main`** — it
creates conflicts the sync agent has to redo. Wait for the sync to merge
first.

### PRs

Use the REST endpoint via `curl`, not `gh pr create` (the project's PAT
allows the REST mutation but not the GraphQL one used by `gh`). Templates
live in `opencode-sync.md` and `harness-sync.md`.

### Filtered typecheck

Root `bun run typecheck` uses a turbo filter limiting to the packages we
ship (`@browser-use/browsercode-core`, `@browser-use/bcode-browser`,
`@opencode-ai/{shared,plugin,sdk}`). This avoids upstream packages we
don't build (e.g. `enterprise`, `web`, `console`). The pre-push hook
runs this filtered command.
=======
## V2 Session Core

- Keep durable prompt admission separate from model execution. `SessionV2.prompt(...)` admits one durable `session_input` row before scheduling advisory `SessionExecution.wake(sessionID)` unless `resume: false` requests admit-only behavior. The serialized runner promotes admitted inputs into visible user messages at safe boundaries.
- Reusing a Session ID adopts the existing Session. Reusing a prompt message ID reconciles an exact retry only when Session, prompt, and delivery mode match; conflicting reuse fails. Historical projected prompts lazily synthesize promoted inbox records during exact retry.
- Keep `SessionExecution` process-global and Session-ID based. Its local implementation owns the process-local Session coordinator and discovers placement through `SessionStore` plus `LocationServiceMap.get(session.location)` only when a drain starts; no layer should take a Session ID. V2 interruption targets the active process-local ownership chain for that Session; idle or missing interruption is a no-op.
- Keep `SessionRunner`, model resolution, tool registry, permissions, and filesystem Location-scoped. Omitted `Location.workspaceID` means implicit-local placement; explicit workspace identity remains reserved for future placement semantics.
- Preserve one explicit `llm.stream(request)` call per provider turn and reload projected history before durable continuation. Do not bridge through legacy `SessionPrompt.loop(...)` or delegate orchestration to an in-memory tool loop.
- Keep local Session drains process-local until clustering is implemented. `SessionRunCoordinator` joins explicit same-Session resumes, coalesces prompt wakeups, and allows different Sessions to run concurrently. Advisory wakes drain eligible durable inbox rows only; post-crash continuation recovery requires a separate explicit design before it may retry provider work. A drain has no durable identity or transcript boundary.
- Keep delivery vocabulary explicit. Prompts steer by default and promote at the next safe provider-turn boundary while the current drain requires continuation. An explicit `queue` input remains pending until the Session would otherwise become idle; promote one queued input at that boundary, then reevaluate continuation before promoting another. Promoting any new user input resets the selected agent's provider-turn allowance; a batch of steers resets it once.
- Keep EventV2 replay owner claims separate from clustered Session execution ownership.
- Keep the System Context algebra, registry, and built-ins in `src/system-context`; keep Context Source producers with their observed domains, and keep Session History selection plus Context Epoch persistence Session-owned.
