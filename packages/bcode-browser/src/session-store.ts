// Process-scope per-opencode-session CDP Session map.
//
// `browser_execute` looks up a `Session` keyed by `sessionID` so that calls
// to `session.connect(...)` made inside one snippet persist across later
// snippets in the same opencode session — the agent connects once, drives
// many. The Session is a single CDP transport (one WebSocket); the agent
// is the source of truth for which browser is on the other end.
//
// Lifetime: Sessions live for the life of the opencode process. The
// underlying WebSocket closes naturally when the browser exits. The agent
// can also close explicitly from a snippet (`await session.close()`) — for
// instance, before reconnecting to a different browser.
//
// `evict(sessionID)` is exposed for tests to clean up between cases. It
// closes the Session and removes the entry. Production code does not need
// to call it; sessions are cheap and the process will exit eventually.
